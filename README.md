# pyTSon_repository

This is the "official" repository for [pyTSon's](https://github.com/pathmann/pyTSon) plugins.

How to add a script
-------------------
Just open a [pull request](https://github.com/pathmann/pyTSon_repository/compare) with your scriptfile and your metadata included in https://github.com/pathmann/pyTSon_repository/blob/master/repository.json.

URLs
-----
You may want to predict URLs from https://cdn.rawgit.com, if you are not sure about the tag, just use the current date (preferable in format yyyy-MM-dd) or simply come up with some cool name. But make sure, it is unique in https://github.com/pathmann/pyTSon_repository/tags.

Wanna keep it updated yourself?
--------------------------------
This repository is currently always included by default in every pyTSon installation, but users may add their own "local" repositories. Todo that, publish your repository.json and your scriptfiles online and spread your repository link.
